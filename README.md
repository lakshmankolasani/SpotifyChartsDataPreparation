# Data Preparation for Tableau dashboard that shows an overview of Top 10 Tracks from Spotify Global Charts Charts

The Dashboard was designed with Data mined using Spotipy, a lightweight Python library for Spotify Web API, on 10/20/2019. 

Target audience for this Dashboard are assumed as Artists or Record Labels who would like to keep a tab on the top trending tracks and their audio features. 

The Interactive Dashboard shows list of top 10 Tracks, their audio features, 30 seconds song previews, and their trends over past 3 weeks.

Running the code will output 2 data files to be used to create Tableau Dashboard.
